🌐 Software Engineering Info Hub – Built with Flask & AI Integration

Welcome to my project! This website was built using Flask, a lightweight and powerful Python web framework, which I learned to use during my internship at OpenQQuantify. The goal of this platform is to provide clear, accessible information about Software Engineering to help users explore the field and connect with others.

🚀 What I Built

Flask Web App: Developed the site backend using Flask, managing routing, templates, and logic efficiently.

AI Integration: Integrated an AI-powered assistant to answer questions and provide insights on a wide range of software engineering topics.

Live Chat Feature: Implemented a real-time chat system to allow users to collaborate, share advice, and discuss ideas instantly.

Glossary Section: Created a searchable glossary of key software engineering terms to support learners and clarify technical language.

Career Paths Page: Designed a section outlining different software engineering career paths—such as Frontend, Backend, DevOps, and AI/ML—helping users plan their journeys.

💡 What I Learned

During my internship at OpenQQuanitfy, I gained hands-on experience with:

Flask web development and backend logic

Template rendering with Jinja2
