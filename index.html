      <h2>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Clarify what needs to be built.</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Engineer the system structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Develop the code.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Confirm the code works.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Deliver the software.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Improve and fix issues over time.</li>
      </ul>

      
      
      
      
      
      <p class = "sdlc-summary">
      The software development lifecycle is important as it is needed to build 
      a software application. This development goes through a procedure in which
      there are several stages. Additionally, developers add features that are 
      needed while also fixing bugs in the software.  

      The first stage includes the planning phase. The planning phase includes duties like arranging,
      examining and granting. In this stage. The team of developers recieves information from customers,manangers and 
      experts to create a document that is needed for software demands. This document has expectations
      that needs to be met through commmon goals that help when the project is planned.

      The second stage includes the design phase. In the design phase, software engineers try to find the 
      best solution to create the software. Software engineers need to analyze what is needed in order for 
      this to be executed. 

      The third stage includes the implementation phase. This is where the product is programmed by a team
      of developers. Coding tasks are broken down into smaller bits so it can be manageable to accomplish. 
      The requirements for the coding tasks that are indentified is analyzed daily. 

      The fourth stage includes the deployment phase. This is when software is developed by teams and tests are 
      done on the different copies of software than the one that the users have access to. Production is the software 
      that customers use. Other copies are to be in the build enviroment or the testing enviroment. Build and prod
      uction envirpments are important as they make sure the customer can use the software even if it is altered by 
      changing or upgrading within the enviroments. This phase includes many tasks that move the lastest build copy to the 
      production enviroment. Examples include packaging, installation and environment configuration. 
      
      The last phase includes the maintenance phase. This includes the team fixing bugs, helping customers with issues, and 
      managing software changes. Overall, system performance is monitored and the security performance of the 
      the user experience. This is all to find out ways to to improve the software.

      <h2>4 Main Attributes of Software Engineering</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Efficiency: </strong> How efficientley a software product is utlizied within sysytem resources in order to perform at its full functionality.   </li>
        <li><strong>Reliability: </strong> The software is ensured that it is consistently produced with efficient results with conditions that are consistent. </li>
        <li><strong>Reuseability: </strong> The capacity in which a software module is refered to, so it can be used across many different kinds of applications and systems.  </li>
        <li><strong>Maintainability: </strong> When the software ability is altered to the point where it needs to be fixed or upgraded easily with requirements changing. </li>

      <h2>Careers in Software Engineering</h2>
         
          <p>
          There are many computing job choices to consider when a degree or experience related to software engineering is accomplished and is ready to be utilized. 
          Most software engineers are given the opportunity to get good paying careers with a professional experience resulting in 
          great progrress. Outcomes or possibilites depend on the individuals region, school and industry. Here are the following job roles in software
          engineering:
          </p>

          <h3>Common Job Roles in Software Engineering:</h3>

          <li><strong>Web Designer</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Quality Assurance Engineer</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Web Desginer</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Cloud Engineer</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Front-End Developer</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Back-End Developer</strong></li>
          <li><strong>DevOps Engineer</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Security Engineer</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Technical Skills: </h3>

          <ul>
          <li><strong>Coding and computer programming</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Software testing</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Object-oriented design</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Software development</strong></li>
          </ul>
         <h3> Soft Skills:</h3>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Communication skills</strong></li>

          <li><strong>Problem solving</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Attention to detail</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Advantages of Software Engineering Include:</h3>
          <p>Quality that is improved from a software that is established and followed so that it can be developed with a small amount of bugs with more reliablity. 
          Productivity is also improved creating a enviroment using tools that are modern and methologies that streamline development processes to ensure developers 
          are more productive and can complete projects faster. Another advantage includes better maintanability which includes the software becoming designed and 
          developed using software engineering pratices so that it is easy to keep up with and update over a period of time. Software engineering can reduce the cost 
          of fixing bugs by indentifying problems and addressing them in the development process. Adding features later on can also contribute to this. When developing
          software it is important that it meets the customer needs by ensuring the development process is efficient. Scalability is important to consider specially 
          when to comes to handling the increasing amount of users and transactions. Efficient Security is important to consider because of the security tests that are performed, 
          which can help prevent breaches and protect sensitive data. 

          Overall, software engineering provides a structured and efficient path to software development. This can lead to better quality software which allows the software to be
          easily maintained and adaptive to altering requirements.
